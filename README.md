Implementation


Here are the things I've been working on:

  -Player has animations, did this mostly so I can use the crouch animation to test out crouching behind rocks for future things
 
  -Created Falling Stalagtite prefab and Plant Spitter Pre fab, although the latter is not finished.
  
  -Worked on level 1, creating more of the map.
