# Demmendaal-MART-391-Game-Engines
Milestone!


Here are the things I've been working on. So far I have a complete story written down, movement, my camera and game controller, and some assets to create maps with. Player sprite will definitly change if I can help it, this is just a stand in for now. I think I am a little behind scehedule but I feel like I can make up that time once I get more comfortable with the ground works stuff.

I also have no idea how to use GitHub.
